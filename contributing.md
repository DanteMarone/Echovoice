  Always create a new branch for your work to keep changes organized and make integration easier.

- **Commit Messages:**  
  Write clear and concise commit messages. Explain the "what" and "why" of your changes.

- **Testing:**  
  Ensure that any code changes do not break existing functionality. Add unit tests where appropriate and test changes in a controlled environment.

  Use Lua for the addon part, and follow the conventions established in the existing codebase (naming, formatting, and structure).
